Check out our [<kbd>Discord Community</kbd>](https://discord.gg/aYBrWe5Jtt)!

# Installation
You can download the mod on the [<kbd>releases page</kbd>](https://github.com/gXLg/libr-getter/releases/latest) on GitHub
or from Modrinth: [<kbd>Modrinth page</kbd>](https://modrinth.com/mod/libr-getter)

You can also build the project yourself, for this just clone the repository and run `./gradlew build`.
The compiled jar should be under `build/libs/`.

# Usage
## Enchantments in the goals list
1. Add enchantments to the goals list through `/librget add <desired enchantment> [desired level] [maximum price in emeralds]`,
   where the desired level parameter is optional and defaults to the max level
   and price parameter is optional and defaults to 64
2. The goals may be removed through `/librget remove <enchantment> <level>`
   or fully cleared using `/librget clear`
3. To list all added enchantments use `/librget list`. The output will contain `(remove)`-button
   after each enchantment, which can be clicked.

## Customization
### Levels
Datapacks/Mods may modify villagers to trade with higher levels of
enchantments than what is set in vanilla. You may enter any value in the `level` argument
to add an enchantment with a greater level to the goals list.

### Enchantments
By default, LibrGetter only parses enchantments available on the client.
If you play on a sever, the list of enchantments may be modified through a server-side
plugin to which the client has no access to.

LibrGetter `add` command has an edge case where you can add custom enchantments in the form
of a minecraft id. To use this feature, your enchantment has to be put in double quotes like `"enchantmentsolution:sand_veil"`.
Note, that when adding a custom enchantment to the goals list, the level argument is required too.

You can read more about plugins compatibility [<kbd>further below</kbd>](#Compatibility)

### Warning
Adding custom enchantments or levels exceeding the vanilla maximum sends a warning into the chat by default.
This warning also includes non-tradable enchantments. You can enable/disable all the warnings with the config option `warning`.

## Start
### Manual
1. Face a librarian and type `/librget` (client-side command)
2. Face his lectern and type `/librget` once again
3. You can then start by running `/librget start`

### Automatic
`/librget auto` automatically selects a lectern and a librarian in 4 blocks radius and starts the process.
This should only be used when there is only one villager and only one lectern near you, or else
the mod could make a wrong selection.

## Stop
Stopping a process is as simple as writing `/librget stop`. After stopping the process you can continue
with `/librget start`.

## Config
* `/librget config notify <true/false>` - enable/disable sound notification when finding an enchantment (default: false).
* `/librget config autoTool <true/false>` - enable/disable automatic tool selection (default: true).
  * When true: each time before breaking the lectern mod chooses most efficient tool, which has more than 10 durability points.
  * When false: mod remembers which tool you are holding when starting the process and switches to exactly this tool each time before breaking.
    If holding nothing or a non-tool item, no tool will be picked.
  * This config has no effect when manual mode is enabled
* `/librget config actionBar <true/false>` - enable/disable logging found enchantments into the action bar instead of chat (default: false).
* `/librget config lock <true/false>` - enable/disable locking the trades after match (default: false).
  * In order to lock a trade you will need to have one of the following inventory configurations:
    * 24 paper to sell and 9 emeralds to buy a bookshelf.
    * 1 book and an amount of emeralds equalling to the most expensive expected book.
  * This config has no effect when manual mode is enabled
* `/librget config removeGoal <true/false>` - enable/disable removing the goal from goals list when being found (default: false).
  * When false: when an enchantment is found, the `(remove)`-button will appear in the message.
* `/librget config checkUpdate <true/false>` - enable/disable checking if a new update has been released (default: true).
  * An update message will appear in the chat once on the first world/server join. If you have [<kbd>Mod Menu</kbd>](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu),
    it will show you a blue dot whenever a new version is available, regardless of this config.
* `/librget config warning <true/false>` - enable/disable warning when custom enchantments format is used (default: true).
* `/librget config offhand <true/false>` - enable/disable putting the lectern in the offhand for higher efficiency (default: false).
  * The process becomes a bit more efficient if you don't have to switch slots in order to place the lectern.
  * Note: you will need to have more than one lectern in your inventory in order to increase efficiency.
  * Note: you can also place the lectern in the offhand without the `offhand` config and it will remain there.
  * This config has no effect when manual mode is enabled
* `/librget config manual <true/false>` - enable/disable manual mode (default: false).
  * Manual mode disables the automatic breaking and replacing of lecterns as well as trade locking and clicking the librarian for you, and gives you more control about the functionality.
  * Even though automatic clicking is disabled, you will only have to click the villager but the trades will be automatically parsed and the merchant screen will be automatically closed.
  * When enabled, upon finding an enchantment from the goals list, the mod will switch to a state, where you can not break any lecterns.
    To finish the process you will have to use `/librget stop`.
* `/librget config waitLose <true/false>` - enable/disable waiting for villager to lose profession (default: false).
  * Villagers will usually update the profession, when the lectern is replaced.
    Although, in some situations, server-side lag may be so high, that this doesn't happen.
    If you experience lags, this option is recommended to turn on.
  * The waiting mode will slow down the process by around 1-2 ticks without lag, but will guarantee, that the villager updates its profession.
  * When manual mode is enabled, during this waiting the placing of the lectern is disabled on the client
* `/librget config safeChecker <true/false>` - enable/disable the safe checker (default: true).
  * Checks if the villager could interfere with the placing process by running over the lecterns position.
  * If the villager is inside a vehicle, the test if positive by default.
* `/librget config timeout <int [0; 20]>` - Time in seconds to wait for a villager to update its profession before replacing the lectern
  * If set to 0, this option is disabled (default)
  * If set to any other number, the mod will hang in a state, where it waits for the villager to accept the librarian profession
    for the specified amount of time, until it reaches the timeout, then it will break and replace the lectern again
  * When manual mode is enabled, the lectern is to be replaced manually.
* `/librget config fallback <true/false>` - Fallback option to search for unsupported enchantments (default: false)
  * Takes all the data given about trades from the villager, convert it to text and search for all enchantment IDs currently in the goals list.
  * It is not guaranteed to make a match, and can cause false positives.
  * May cause lag with a large list of enchantments.
  * Use only as a temporary solution, if the plugin you are playing with is not supported.
* `/librget config look <true/false>` - Change head rotation between breaking the lectern and talking to the villager (default: true)
  * When enabled, LibrGetter will send "look at" packets to the server and update the player head rotation.
  * This config has no effect when manual mode is enabled.
* `/librget config rotation <true/false>` - Imitate natural player head rotation (default: false)
  * When enabled, LibrGetter will smoothly rotate the head between breaking the lectern and talking to the villager, which slows down the process
  * This config has no effect when manual mode is enabled or when `look` is disabled

## Compatibility config
This list of configs enables/disables compatibility with different client-side mods, possibly modifying the process of finding an enchantment.
All compatibility configs are set to `false` by default.
To learn more about what each mod compatibility changes, read further below.

* `/librget config _tradeCycling <true/false>` - Trade Cycling

## View Config
You can use `/librget config <config>` to print out the currently set value.
In addition to that you can modify the config file manually. The file is located at `<minecraft folder>/config/librgetter.json`

## Config Menu
LibrGetter provides a keybind to open a book GUI with clickable configs
and their short description. By default, the keybind is set to the letter <kbd>K</kbd>. 

# Compatibility
## Client Side Mods
LibrGetter tries to be compatible with all other mods, by modifying the client as little as possible.

Mods that previously were not compatible and were made explicitly compatible:
* OffersHUD ([<kbd>Modrinth</kbd>](https://modrinth.com/mod/offershud))

Mods that add/change functionality of LibrGetter:
### Trade Cycling

With Trade Cycling ([<kbd>Modrinth</kbd>](https://modrinth.com/mod/trade-cycling)) installed on the server, instead of replacing the lectern, LibrGetter will push the cycling button, until an enchantment is found.
Since Trade Cycling requires you to have the Merchant screen open, the process can't be stopped using commands, instead you can close the trading screen to automatically stop.

## Plugins
In recent update, a system with fallback for dynamic plugin support was developed, which allows me to explicitly add new plugins as quick as possible.

The finding of enchantments goes through following steps:
1. Goes over every plugin added explicitly in LibrGetter (see below) and searches for plugin specific enchantments.
2. Tries to find a vanilla enchantment.
3. (optionally) Takes all the data available on the villager and searches for the enchantment string.

Explicitly added plugins:
* Enchantment Solution

Plugins, that are known to be compatible without further adjustments:
* ExcellentEnchants ([<kbd>Modrinth</kbd>](https://modrinth.com/plugin/excellentenchants))

You can request support for more plugins in the [<kbd>issues</kbd>](https://github.com/gXLg/libr-getter/issues).
